const data= "hey tsidered as reward and what should not be considered as reward let me put up in this question a lot of people think that i'll turn off my phone and will play playstation entire day is it a reward yeah for some people yes but is it feasible whole day in a park sounds good but youou want to go to gym you are not gonna be going to gym you want to do a lot of stuff things are going to go bad so here's my small tip don't control your life don't plan for a month don't plan for a year don't take those new year resolution it doesn't work i've tried them myself for some years it works for some years it doesn't work so what instead i try is it's okay to lose control if i'm not able to work out today it's okay i was not able to if i'm not able to code today or make a video today it's okay things happen restart doesn't mean tomorrow also needs to go bad if today is messed up tomorrow i can fix it so i always go ahead and believe and a strong believer of restart i'm a computer guy i know a lot of problem can be solved by just turning off the things and turning on the things restart works this is a proven theory in computers restart always works so most importantly make sure you plan your day and it's okay to mess up try tomorrow again two things that's it in the life just do and plan and prepare for 10 things and here is my last and the most important thing i always end up my ted talks with some of the quotation or some of the theories that i have here's the one a lot of people misunderstand what is time management they want to do a thousand different things you don't do thousand things you take one step at a time you do one thing today right that's it time management is not about doing 100 things it's about just doing a very few things but consistently you want to work out consistently work out you want to write code consistently write code just for two hours a day you want to make youtube videos just make one video a day that's it that's all it takes so make sure to sum this all up it is not possible to master time management you can manage only people it is not possible to master your entire year but it is possible or at least we can try to master today's day and only today's day so make sure you don't run after reading thousand books of time management instead of just try to sort out just today that's it live in the moment try that out so that is all from my side thank you so much youpwafjlakfsdljlklkjfd koiiefa fhiopjFPCJLKJLKJL Fjljl";
